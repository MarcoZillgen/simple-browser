## Why?!?

I am increasingly dissatisfied with modern web browsers. They are overloaded with features that I do not need and that detract from the core browsing experience. A browser should primarily serve as a tool for accessing and navigating the internet, allowing users to immerse themselves in beautifully built websites. Many current browsers offer an excess of unnecessary tools and features that occupy too much visual space; I want to see the websites, not the browser's UI.

This may sound somewhat exaggerated, but it encapsulates my frustration with current browsers. The constant presence of open tabs on the left or top, along with numerous buttons—half of which I have never used—clutters the interface. Although I could use fullscreen mode, it feels restrictive and hinders the quick navigation I desire. My aim with this project is to enhance my browsing experience by developing a truly personalized browser.

I do not consider this project a fully-fledged browser. Rather, it is an experiment to determine if I would genuinely use such a minimalist browser and to see if others share my perspective. It will be a simple Electron app, leveraging a webView to function as a browser, despite having numerous problems and disadvantages associated with this approach.
